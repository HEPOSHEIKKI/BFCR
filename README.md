## Replace filecontents without renaming

This tool can be used to replace the contents of EVERY file in a folder without renaming.

## Usage:
  - -d  Set the directory to edit
  
  - -f  Set the input file that ill be used to replace other files
  
  - -h  Print out a help message
  

## Why?

This tool can be useful for modding for example. I made this tool so I could [replace all Coach's voicelines in L4D2 with NIIICK](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2914699977) and I was not going to edit 2460 .wav files by hand.
